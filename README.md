# VehicleAccidentsInLondon
A visual spatiotemporal analysis is carried out in order to analyze vehicle accidents with different factors involved that could have impact on the accidents, using the record collected by UK transport department between 2 years that ranges between 2012-2014.

## Summary

The spatial patterns involving vehicle accidents hotspots are presented through density maps and temporal patterns are demonstrated through bar plots and heat maps. Python is used for visualizing patterns, furthermore, guiding the analytical process. Using the DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithm clusters are identified as the areas of highest density which will be beneficial for the traffic management which can optimize and therefore mitigate the chances of vehicle accidents.
